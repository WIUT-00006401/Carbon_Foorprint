This project is created as a part of the assignment from Computer Programming module in GISMA University of Applied Sciences. The primary functionality of this tool revolves around enabling users to input data concerning their energy consumption, waste generation, and travel habits. Upon processing this data, the tool calculates the overall carbon footprint and generates detailed reports. These reports highlight areas where emissions exceed recommended limits and offer suggestions for reducing their carbon footprint. From a technical standpoint, the project utilizes a combination of Python for backend calculations and Streamlit for creating an interactive web interface.
